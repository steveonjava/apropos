# Welcome to Apropos #

Apropos is an open source agile planning tool focused on large team Agile Portfolio Planning.  The typical use of Apropos would be an organization that:
  * Uses an Agile development process like XP, Scrum, or Kanban
  * Has multiple Agile teams that need to coordinate
  * Makes use of an Agile Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool to track their team progress

The last point is very important.  Apropos is designed to work in tandem with your existing ALM tool, not replace it.  Most ALM tools do not provide the full tool set to support a Agile Product Portfolio Scheduling, which is where Apropos comes in.

Some of the benefits that you can realize from implementing an Agile Portfolio Process using Apropos as the foundation include:
  * Synergies with downstream organizations such as Operations, Professional Services, and Sales
  * Increased delivery value through organization-wide alignment of priorities
  * Continuous improvement enabled by whole process feedback loops
  * Realtime visibility into delivery status and potential blockages

For more details, here is a presentation on Reformulating the Delivery Process that Israel Gat, Erik Huddleston, and I presented at the Lean Software Systems Conference:

## Apropos Walkthrough ##

## Setting up Your Own Project ##

More information available soon.

## About the Tool ##

The codebase is written in JavaFX with a next generation RIA user interface.

The current version of Apropos is designed to work with Rally Community Edition, which is free for use with a team of up to 10.  It can also be run against Rally Enterprise Edition, but requires some configuration and setup (see section below on setting up your own project).  Support for integrating with other Agile Lifecycle Management products is planned.
